abstract = {In real world applications, there are many multi-objective optimization problems. Most existing multi-objective optimization algorithms focus on improving the diversity, spread and convergence of the solutions in the objective space. Few works study the distribution of solutions in the decision space. In practical applications, some multi-objective problems have different Pareto sets with the same objective values and these problems are defined as multimodal multi-objective optimization problems. It is of great significance to provide all the Pareto sets for the decision maker. This paper describes the concept of multimodal multi-objective optimization problems in detail. Novel test functions are also designed to judge the performance of different algorithms. Moreover, some existing multi-objective algorithms are tested and compared. Finally, a decision space based niching multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is proposed to solve these problems. The experimental results suggest that existing multi-objective optimization algorithms fail to find all the Pareto sets while the proposed algorithm is able to find almost all the Pareto sets without deteriorating the distribution of solutions in the objective space.},

@article{NSGA-III,
abstract = {—Having developed multi-objective optimization al-gorithms using evolutionary optimization methods and demon-strated their niche on various practical problems involving mostly two and three objectives, there is now a growing need for developing evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithms for handling many-objective (having four or more objectives) optimization problems. In this paper, we recognize a few recent efforts and discuss a number of viable directions for developing a potential EMO algorithm for solving many-objective optimization problems. Thereafter, we suggest a reference-point based many-objective NSGA-II (we call it NSGA-III) that em-phasizes population members which are non-dominated yet close to a set of supplied reference points. The proposed NSGA-III is applied to a number of many-objective test problems having two to 15 objectives and compared with two versions of a recently suggested EMO algorithm (MOEA/D). While each of the two MOEA/D methods works well on different classes of problems, the proposed NSGA-III is found to produce satisfactory results on all problems considered in this study. This paper presents results on unconstrained problems and the sequel paper considers constrained and other specialties in handling many-objective optimization problems.},

abstract = {This paper discusses how preference information of the decision maker can in general be integrated into multiobjective search. The main idea is to first define the optimization goal in terms of a binary performance measure (indicator) and then to directly use this measure in the selection process. To this end, we propose a general indicator-based evolutionary algorithm (IBEA) that can be combined with arbitrary indicators. In contrast to existing algorithms, IBEA can be adapted to the preferences of the user and moreover does not require any additional diversity preservation mechanism such as fitness sharing to be used. It is shown on several continuous and discrete benchmark problems that IBEA can substantially improve on the results generated by two popu- lar algorithms, namely NSGA-II and SPEA2, with respect to different performance measures.},

Different mutation schemes are compared by computing the expected progress to the solution. The numerical performance of the BGA is demonstrated on a test suite of multimodal functions. The number of function evaluations needed to locate the optimum scales only as n ln(n) where n is the number of parameters. Results up to n = 1000 are reported. }

Real-parameter GAs (RGAs) handle real-valued variables directly without going to a binary string representation of variables. Although RGAs were first suggested in early ‘90s, the mutation operator is still implemented variable-wise – in a manner that is independent to each variable. In this paper, we investigate the effect of five different mutation schemes for RGAs using two different mutation operators – polynomial and Gaussian mutation operators. Based on extensive simulation studies, it is observed that amutation clock implementation is computationally quick and also efficient in finding a solution close to the optimum on four different problems used in this study for both mutation operators. Moreover, parametric studies with their associated parameters reveal suitable working ranges of the parameters. Interestingly, both mutation operators with their respective optima...},

This paper proposes a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D). It decomposes a multiobjective optimization problem into a number of scalar optimization subproblems and optimizes them simultaneously. Each subproblem is optimized by only using information from its several neighboring subproblems, which makes MOEA/D have lower computational complexity at each generation than MOGLS and nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). Experimental results have demonstrated that MOEA/D with simple decomposition methods outperforms or performs similarly to MOGLS and NSGA-II on multiobjective 0-1 knapsack problems and continuous multiobjective optimization problems. It has been shown that MOEA/D using objective normalization can deal with disparately-scaled objectives, and MOEA/D with an advanced decomposition method can generate a set of very evenly distributed solutions for 3-objective test instances. The ability of MOEA/D with small population, the scalability and sensitivity of MOEA/D have also been experimentally investigated in this paper.},
